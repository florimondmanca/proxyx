# ProxyCore

Proof of concept for a lightweight HTTP/1.1 proxy service built with [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io) and [HTTPCore](https://github.com/encode/httpcore). No maintenance intended.

## Setup

Clone this repository, then install dependencies:

```bash
scripts/install
```

## Example

```bash
scripts/example
```

This will proxy https://www.encode.io/httpcore (the HTTPCore documentation) from `localhost:8000`.
